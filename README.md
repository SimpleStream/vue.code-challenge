## Overview

The purpose of this code test is to help us understand your style of coding, technical proficiency and decision-making process.

If you struggle with understanding the requirements, please don't hesitate to reach out for clarification.

We have provided a simple application boilerplate to get you started.

## Requirements

- Build a simple carousel component without using an existing carousel library
  - It should display thumbnails of video content retrieved from the [API endpoint](http://hybridtv.ss7.tv/techtest/movies.json)
  - Add any additional behaviours, interactions or features that you want, if you have time
  - Any tests are a valued bonus

There are many different solutions to the challenge. We are not looking a specific solution or even a complete solution. Instead we are more interested in your approach.

We have provided a boilerplate component get you started at [`src/components/Carousel.vue`](./src/components/Carousel.vue). It includes some quick examples of `vue-class-components` and a simple call to the API endpoint using `axios`, but feel free to change this to suit your preferences.

We also have [`tests/unit/Carousel.spec.ts`](./tests/unit/Carousel.spec.ts) and [`tests/e2e/specs/test.js`](./tests/e2e/specs/test.js) for unit and e2e tests respectively.

### Delivery requirements

- Clone this repo and create a new repo in your GitHub account
  - Please don't fork this repo in GitHub or your solution will be visible through GitHub UI
- Create a new branch for the code challenge
- When you are done, please push and provide a link to your PR
